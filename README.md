This is my personal dotfiles repository.


## Installation

```sh
cd ~  && git clone https://github.com/mle86/dotfiles .dotfiles/  && .dotfiles/install.sh
```

Run *install.sh* to start the installation process.
Every installation step asks for manual confirmation
and every prompt default is 'no',
so it's safe to run the installation script and hit Enter a few times
just to see what it would do.

If you just want to copy the `bin/` scripts
to `/usr/local/bin/`,
run *root-install.sh*.
It will ask about every bin/ script file,
always defaulting to 'no'.


## bin/

This is my `~/bin/` directory.
It contains small shell and Perl scripts.

* **ds:**  
	This is a prettier variant of "*du -sh * | sort*".
	All it does is list the current directory's contents, summarize their sizes, and sort by size (smallest first).
	Also, the K/M/G/T suffixes are will be colored differently,
	indentation will line up nicely,
	directories will be colored blue in the output,
	and backup files (\*~, \*.bak, \*.bkup, \*.swp) will be colored dark grey.
	Really useful to get an overview which directories are hogging the hard disk space now.  
	Syntax: `ds [DIRECTORY=.]`

* **fn:**  
	This is an abbreviation for "*find . (-name $1 -or -name $2 -or â€¦)*".
	It can also handle additional *find* options (after a single comma).  
	Syntax: `fn [-i] PATTERN... [, FINDOPTS...]`  
	The *-i* option causes *find* to use the *-iname* option (instead of *-name*) for all pattern arguments,
	i.e. it makes the process case-insensitive.

* **g:**  
	An abbreviation for "*grep --line-number --with-filename --ignore-case --color=always*".
	Also, it allows for simple entry of multiple grep patterns.
	Since it is just a *grep* wrapper, it will read *stdin* if no *FILENAME*s are given (or if one of them is `-`).  
	Syntax:
	* `g [GREPOPTION...] PATTERN      [FILENAME...]` (This will search for the *PATTERN* in the *FILENAME*s, or in *stdin*.)
	* `g [GREPOPTION...] PATTERN... , [FILENAME...]` (This will search for any of the *PATTERN*s in the *FILENAME*s, or in *stdin*.)

* **git-color-annotate:**  
	This is a *git-annotate* variant which has colorized output.  
	If *stdout* is a tty, this script will launch the *less* pager.
	Syntax:
	* `git color-annotate [ANNOTATE-OPTIONS] filename`  
		Works like *git-annotate*, but has colorized output.
		This mode is chosen if there are any cmdline arguments,
		which are all passed to a real *git-annotate* child process.
	* `git color-annotate < input`  
		Works as colorizing filter for existing *git-annotate* output.
		This mode is chosen if there are no cmdline arguments
		and if *stdin* is a file or a pipe (but not a tty).

* **keep-n-files:**  
	This will remove the oldest files in *DIR* so that only *N* files remain.
	Alternatively, it can take a list of *FILENAME*s, in which case it will delete the oldest of them until only *N* files remain.
	If there's less than *N* files present, nothing will be deleted.  
	Syntax:
	* `keep-n-files [-n] N DIR`
	* `keep-n-files [-n] N FILENAME...`

* **nocmt:**  
	A simple *grep* abbreviation to filter shell scripts and similar files:
	It will remove all empty lines, all whitespace-only lines,
	and all lines whose first non-whitespace symbol is a hash (*#*).
	Like grep, it can take one or multiple filenames, or it'll simply read *stdin*.  
	Syntax: `nocmt [FILENAME...]`

* **params:**  
	This might be useful to debug other shell scripts which do a lot of argument processing or are involved with `$IFS` magic.
	It will simply show a numbered list of its command line arguments,
	one line each,
	all of them enclosed in colored square brackets to avoid spacing ambiguity.  
	Syntax: `params [ARGUMENT...]`

* **reify:**  
	This Perl script converts symlinks to actual files by copying their link destination.
	Symlinked directories will be copied recursively.  
	Syntax: `reify [-dqv] FILENAME...`  
	* *-d*, *--flat*: Directories won't be copied recursively,
			but filled with symlinks to the original directories' contents.
	* *-q*, *--quiet*: Ignore non-symlink files,
			don't report mode/ownership problems.
	* *-v*, *--verbose*: Report every copied file.

* **u:**  
	This is a "*id $(getent passwd $1)*" wrapper:
	It takes a User ID argument
	and looks up the account's username.  
	Syntax: `u [-n] UID`  
	The *-n* option causes *u* just to print the username
	instead of calling the *id* program with it.


## Some less-boring aliases and functions in .bash_aliases

* **keep:** `IGNOREEOF=99`  
	This causes the bash shell to ignore Ctrl-D logouts.
* **c99:** `gcc -O -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic`
* **ga:** `git add -p`
* **gd:** `git diff --diff-algorithm=minimal`
* **gdc:** `git diff --diff-algorithm=minimal --cached`

* **tf:**
	A *tail -n0 -f* abbreviation.  
	Syntax: `tf [LOGFILE=/var/log/syslog]...`

* **todo:**
	Greps all files in the current directory for 'TODO'.
	Greps in other directories instead if there are any directory arguments.
	Also greps all plain files which are given as arguments.  
	Syntax: `todo [TARGET=.]...`

* **grepf:**
	A combination of *find -name* and *grep*.
	Uses the *~/bin/g* script.  
	Syntax: `grepf FILEPATTERN [GREPOPTIONS...] GREPPATTERNS...`  
	Example: `grepf '*.php' '<? '` to find all usages of the obsolete short opening tag.

* **dx:**
	A *docker exec* shortcut.  
	(Without any arguments, it lists the currently-running containers (`docker ps`).)  
	Syntax: `dx CONTAINERNAME [COMMAND=$SHELL]`

* **T:**
	Creates a new file from a template in *~/.templates/*, then opens it with vim.  
	Existing files will simply be opened, not overwritten.  
	Syntax: `T [FILENAME=test.sh]`
